# Lessons learned

Lessons from building this workflow, including dead ends and wrong
assumptions. They feed the skill, and an article and a talk about starting
WordPress development with Claude. Add new ones as they happen, newest
project first.

## Classic Honeypot for CF7 (October 2026)

The first project: a fork of a classic plugin, taken from development to
WordPress.org submission on Windows 11.

### Development environment

- **Two machines.** Claude and the dev environment ran on one machine on the
  LAN, and the developer worked from another one (remote control). Where a
  server listens and which URL WordPress thinks it has are different problems:
  Playground needs `--site-url http://<LAN IP>:9400`, and Studio custom domains
  need a hosts line on the other machine.
- **Remote control vs UAC.** Studio writes its custom domains to the hosts
  file, which needs a UAC click at the physical PC. The remote user can't see
  the prompt.
- **Windows paths.** Playground's `--mount` breaks on drive letters; use
  `--mount-dir`.
- **Background tasks.** A Playground server started by Claude in the
  background dies after 30 minutes unless given the maximum timeout.
- **Blueprints don't transfer to Studio as-is.** The blueprint activated a
  plugin that the Studio site didn't have yet (it is linked afterwards), so
  its steps had to be redone with WP-CLI.
- **Wrong assumption: Studio's WP-CLI is only for Studio sites.** It also runs
  repo-only tasks with `--studio-no-path`, which removed the need for a
  separate WP-CLI install.
- **Folder name = slug.** Working around a repo folder named differently from
  the plugin slug needed fragile mount paths on Windows. Renaming the folder
  was simpler, and it became a rule of the skill.
- **MCP Adapter over STDIO.** It works through `studio wp mcp-adapter serve`:
  no application password, no network. But out of the box it only exposes
  3 read-only core abilities, so WP-CLI is still far more useful until plugins
  register abilities.
- **Verifying an MCP server.** A fresh headless `claude -p` session is a cheap
  way to check that it loads.

### Working on the plugin

- **Just using the plugin finds bugs.** Contact Form 7 6.2 renamed its menu
  slug (`wpcf7` to `wpcf7-dashboard`), so the plugin's settings page had become
  invisible. The developer had used the plugin for years without knowing it had
  settings.
- **Changelogs are not enough to audit fixes.** To decide which later fixes to
  port, the changelog was too vague: read the code. Most fixes in later
  versions fixed features added in those versions, so they didn't apply to
  the fork.
- **Ask for exactly what to remove.** When asked to tone down one thing in the
  readme, Claude over-corrected and removed too much.

### Release

- **Plugin Check on a linked site scans the whole repo.** It only takes a slug,
  so it even flagged `.claude/`. Use `--exclude-directories` and
  `--exclude-files`, and check the real package built with `git archive`.
- **PowerShell pipes corrupt binary output.** `git archive | tar` fails; write
  to a file with `-o`.
- **Headless Chrome for assets.** `playwright-core` driving the installed
  Chrome gives clean 1280x800 screenshots and renders an HTML banner at both
  sizes. Keep the banner source in a folder excluded from the release zip.
- **Explain to reviewers up front.** Keep reviewer-facing explanations in the
  code (`phpcs:ignore` with a reason) and in the submission's "Additional
  Information" field.
- **First submission.** The automated scan passed on the first try once Plugin
  Check was clean. The manual review queue had about 243 plugins.
